High-Level Overview of the Elevate System (First draft)
1. Mission Statement & Core Premise
Elevate is an AI-powered learning co-pilot designed to facilitate deep mastery of complex subjects. It operates on the core premise that effective learning occurs at the intersection of technology and human cognition. Elevate achieves this by fusing the latest in cognitive science with the oldest, most effective memory techniques, creating a partnership between the user and the AI.

2. The Pillars of Learning: A Fusion of Science and Strategy
Elevate's architecture is built upon a foundation of proven learning principles, which serve as its main pillars:

Active Recall: The system is designed to constantly engage the user in the act of actively retrieving information. This is primarily achieved through sophisticated, AI-generated quizzes created from the user's own source material. Uniquely, Elevate's AI also marks the user's free-text answers, providing nuanced, specific feedback that goes beyond simple right/wrong.
Spaced Repetition (SRS): Elevate integrates an SRS engine that schedules reviews of material at scientifically optimized intervals to combat the forgetting curve. While the system automates this for maximum efficiency, it also offers flexibility, allowing users to manually set their own review dates if they prefer to follow a self-directed schedule.
The Learning Catalyst: A key, unique feature where the AI acts as a creative memory partner. A Learning Catalyst is a custom mnemonic device—such as a vivid analogy, memorable imagery, or a clever acronym—that the AI generates specifically to help the user anchor a difficult or abstract concept in their memory.
3. The Core Engine: The Learning Blueprint
The engine that powers these pillars is a sophisticated two-phase process that deconstructs knowledge:

Phase 1: Deconstruction: Elevate's AI analyzes source text and structures it into a detailed LearningBlueprint. This blueprint identifies the material's core components and UUE (Understand, Use, Explore) structure, and also flags abstract concepts that are prime candidates for a Learning Catalyst.
Phase 2: Synthesis: This structured blueprint becomes the definitive source for generating materials that facilitate the learning pillars, including comprehensive AI-generated notes and the active recall quizzes.
4. The Personalization Engine: The "Evolving Brain"
Elevate builds a deep, evolving "Cognitive Profile" for each user via the UserMemory system. This deeply personalizes the entire experience, from note generation to chat interactions. This profile consists of:

Explicit Preferences & Goals: Users have granular control over how the AI interacts with them. In their profile (or on-the-fly during a chat), they can set preferences like:

Cognitive Approach: TOP_DOWN (big picture first) vs. BOTTOM_UP (details first).
Explanation Style: ANALOGY_DRIVEN, PRACTICAL_EXAMPLES, or TEXTUAL_DETAILED.
Interaction Style: DIRECT (to-the-point) vs. SOCRATIC (guiding with questions). Users can also set concrete goals, such as "I am studying for my final exam on December 15th," or define their current focus, like "I'm trying to improve my knowledge of Python decorators." The AI uses these goals to prioritize and contextualize its assistance.
Inferred Knowledge: The AI "Librarian" agent analyzes conversations and performance to learn about the user, tracking their ConceptMastery, identifying recurring UserErrorPatterns, and noting which types of Learning Catalysts are most effective for them.

5. The Interactive Co-Pilot: The Agentic RAG System
The chat feature is a state-of-the-art Agentic RAG system that transforms how users interact with their study materials.

Transforms Reading into an Active Dialogue: While reading the AI-generated notes, the user can chat with the co-pilot in a side-by-side view. The AI, aware of the content and the user's profile, can answer questions. More importantly, it can proactively ask consolidation questions to ensure the user is truly understanding, such as "Can you summarize that last section in your own words?" or "Explain this concept to me like I'm five years old." This turns passive reading into a deeply active and effective dialogue.
Acts as a Creative Partner: The agent can be prompted to generate a Learning Catalyst on the fly for any topic the user is struggling with.
Is Self-Correcting: It employs a "Critique-Reflect-Generate" loop to verify its own statements against the source material, which builds user trust.
6. The Data-Driven Coach: Learning from History
Elevate uses historical interaction data (UserQuestionAnswer, UserStudySession, masteryHistory) to provide insights that feel like a personal coach. It can provide specific feedback on past mistakes, comment on study consistency, provide motivation by showing tangible progress, and proactively intervene if a user's learning has plateaued.

7. Metacognition & Self-Awareness: Understanding How You Learn
A core goal of Elevate is to empower users with metacognition—the ability to understand their own learning process. The system makes the invisible act of learning visible through:

A Detailed Stats Page: A central dashboard where users can see a comprehensive overview of their learning habits and strengths.
Mastery Over Time Graphs: Charts that visually represent a user's journey from novice to expert in a specific topic.
Visualizing the Forgetting Curve: Elevate can show a user their personal forgetting curve for a given topic and how each scheduled review successfully "flattens" that curve, giving direct visual feedback on the power of the SRS system.
8. The Technical Architecture: The "Conductor & Specialist" Model
The system is built on a modern, scalable microservice architecture:

The Core API (The Conductor): The main backend that handles users, data persistence in PostgreSQL, and orchestration.
The AI API (The Specialist): A Python-based service for all complex AI logic.
Workflow Orchestration (e.g., Apache Airflow): Manages all asynchronous background tasks, such as LearningBlueprint ingestion and the "Librarian" agent's analysis of past conversations.
