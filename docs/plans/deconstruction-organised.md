The Elevate Learning Blueprint: Complete System Architecture
Executive Summary
The Elevate Learning Blueprint transforms raw educational content into a sophisticated, AI-powered learning system through a two-phase deconstruction process. Rather than simple summarization, it creates structured knowledge models that enable personalized, intelligent content generation and retrieval.
Core Innovation: Two-Phase AI Deconstruction
Phase 1: Analysis & Blueprint Generation
The system analyzes source text to create a comprehensive Learning Blueprint - a structured JSON knowledge model containing:

Foundational Concepts: Hierarchical breakdown of core facts and definitions
Use Cases: Practical examples linked to foundational concepts
Explorations: Open-ended synthesis questions
Key Terms: Context-specific glossary
Relationship Mapping: Knowledge graph connections
Common Misconceptions: Predicted learning pitfalls
Insight Catalyst Opportunities: Complex concepts flagged for analogies

Phase 2: Personalized Content Generation
Using the blueprint + user preferences (UserMemory), the system generates:

Tailored Notes: Various styles (Concise/Thorough/Explorative) with fidelity control
Intelligent Questions: Targeted by UUE focus (Understand/Use/Explore)
Multiple Versions: Stored permanently for instant switching

  "conceptId": "F1",
  "keyIdea": "Main concept definition",
  "subKeyIdeas": ["Supporting detail 1", "Supporting detail 2"],
  "summaryForRouting": "Keywords for AI routing"

Advanced RAG System Architecture
Router Agent Pattern

High-Level Routing: AI first identifies relevant documents using blueprint summaries
Scoped Vector Search: Searches only within identified documents with metadata filtering
Contextual Response: Synthesizes answers from targeted, relevant chunks

Benefits

90% cost reduction vs. full-document search
Massive accuracy improvement through noise elimination
Faster response times with focused retrieval

Database Schema
Primary Models
prismamodel LearningBlueprint {
  id            Int         @id @default(autoincrement())
  content       Json        // Complete blueprint JSON
  questionSetId Int         @unique
  questionSet   QuestionSet @relation(fields: [questionSetId], references: [id])
}

model GeneratedNoteVersion {
  id              Int         @id @default(autoincrement())
  versionName     String      // e.g., "Quick Summary", "Essay Draft"  
  content         Json        // BlockNote JSON content
  noteStyleUsed   String      // "CONCISE", "THOROUGH", "EXPLORATIVE"
  fidelityUsed    String      // "STRICT", "CREATIVE"
  questionSetId   Int

Agentic Implementation Plan
Sprint 1: AI Service Core (Python/LlamaIndex)
Focus: Building the intelligent agent with tools
Key Tasks

Setup LlamaIndex + vector database (pgvector)
Create agentic tools:

vector_query_tool: Search blueprints
web_search_tool: Real-time web search
create_note/create_question_set: Application actions


Build main agent router using Gemini
Refactor chat endpoint for agent-driven responses

Sprint 2: Backend Orchestration (Node.js)
Focus: Secure tool execution
Key Tasks

Implement service-to-service authentication
Create internal API endpoints (/api/internal/)
Connect Python service to Core API for tool execution
Enable full agentic loop: decision → action → confirmation

Sprint 3: Frontend Experience (React)
Focus: Transparent agentic behavior
Key Tasks

Enhanced chat state management for tool events
Real-time tool visualization ("Searching web...", "Creating note...")
Multi-version note switching interface
Guided generation workflow

User Experience Flow
Content Generation Journey
Step 1: Source Input

User clicks "Add +" → "Generate from Source"
Clean interface: Title field + Source text area
Single action: "Analyze & Create Blueprint"

Step 2: Blueprint Review

Success confirmation with summary:

"Key Ideas Found: 5"
"Practical Examples: 2"
"Topics for Exploration: 1"


Generation options appear:

Notes: Style (Concise/Thorough/Explorative), Fidelity (Strict/Creative)
Questions: UUE Focus (Understand/Use/Explore/Balanced), Scope (Essence/Thorough)



Step 3: Generation & Storage

AI generates content using source text + blueprint + user preferences
Multiple versions stored permanently
Instant switching between versions (no re-generation cost)

Chat Experience Evolution

Before: Simple Q&A chatbot
After: Proactive learning co-pilot that:

Uses blueprints for contextual understanding
Asks targeted Socratic questions
Suggests insight catalysts for difficult concepts
Tests for common misconceptions
Guides deeper exploration



Technical Advantages
Cost Optimization

Blueprint Creation: One-time analysis cost per document
Generation: Targeted prompts vs. full-text summarization
Chat: Router pattern reduces token usage by 90%
Storage: Generated versions cached permanently

Quality Enhancement

Structured Knowledge: Blueprint provides semantic understanding
Personalization: UserMemory integration for learning style adaptation
Accuracy: Source text + blueprint prevents hallucination
Depth: Multi-layer UUE framework ensures comprehensive coverage
