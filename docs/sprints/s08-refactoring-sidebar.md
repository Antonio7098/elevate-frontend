Sprint ##: Frontend - Sidebar Aesthetic Refactor
Date Range: [Start Date] - [End Date]
Primary Focus: Frontend - Sidebar.tsx & Sidebar.module.css
Overview: This sprint focuses on a complete visual refactor of the Sidebar.tsx component. The goal is to keep the existing hover-to-expand functionality but update the aesthetic to a clean, modern, and sharp design inspired by user-provided wireframes and screenshots (e.g., the dark theme from image_162330.png and the item layout from image_6a95d5.png).

I. Planned Tasks & To-Do List
[x] Task 1: Verify and Refine Hover-to-Expand Logic

- [x] Sub-task 1.1: In Sidebar.module.css, updated the .sidebar class to use a collapsed width of 5rem and expanded width of 16rem on hover.
- [x] Sub-task 1.2: Confirmed that .linkText and .logoText are hidden by default and become visible on sidebar hover with smooth opacity transitions.
- [x] Sub-task 1.3: Added smooth transitions for both width and opacity properties for a polished user experience.

[x] Task 2: Refactor Navigation Item Styling

- [x] Sub-task 2.1: Updated .navLink styles with transparent background by default and proper text colors.
- [x] Sub-task 2.2: Implemented a prominent active state with primary color background and white text for better visibility.
- [x] Sub-task 2.3: Added subtle hover states with a slightly darker background for better user feedback.

[x] Task 3: Refine Logo and User Area Aesthetics

- [x] Sub-task 3.1: Updated logo area with proper spacing, typography, and smooth transitions.
- [x] Sub-task 3.2: Refactored user profile and logout buttons with consistent styling and distinct hover states.
- [x] Sub-task 3.3: Ensured consistent spacing and sizing across all sidebar elements for a polished look.

[x] Task 4: Update AuthenticatedLayout.tsx for Sidebar Offset

- [x] Sub-task 4.1: Updated the main content area to properly account for the sidebar width on all screen sizes.
- [x] Sub-task 4.2: Implemented proper z-index layering and overlay behavior for the sidebar on mobile devices.

## II. Implementation Summary & Notes

### Key Files Modified:
1. `src/components/layout/Sidebar.module.css` - Updated styles for the collapsible sidebar, navigation items, and user area.
2. `src/components/layout/AuthenticatedLayout.module.css` - Modified layout styles to work with the new sidebar implementation.
3. `src/components/layout/AuthenticatedLayout.tsx` - Added mobile responsiveness and sidebar toggle functionality.
4. `src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` - Updated to support mobile navigation and proper prop types.

### Key Decisions & Challenges:
1. **Responsive Behavior**:
   - Desktop: Sidebar collapses to icons-only and expands on hover
   - Mobile: Sidebar slides in/out from the left with a dark overlay
   - Added smooth transitions for a polished user experience

2. **Styling Approach**:
   - Used CSS Modules for scoped styling
   - Leveraged CSS variables for consistent theming
   - Implemented proper z-index layering for the sidebar overlay

3. **Accessibility**:
   - Added proper ARIA attributes for screen readers
   - Ensured keyboard navigation works correctly
   - Maintained proper color contrast ratios

4. **Performance**:
   - Used CSS transforms for smooth animations
   - Minimized reflows by optimizing transitions
   - Added proper event cleanup in useEffect hooks

### Testing Notes:
- Tested on desktop (hover states)
- Tested on mobile (touch interactions)
- Verified keyboard navigation
- Checked accessibility with screen readers
- Tested across different screen sizes

### Remaining Tasks:
- [ ] Add unit tests for the sidebar component
- [ ] Document the component usage in Storybook
- [ ] Add visual regression tests
