# Sprint ##: Frontend - Learning Preference Diagnostic Test

**Date Range:** [Start Date] - [End Date]
**Primary Focus:** Frontend - Implementing the User Preference Diagnostic Test
**Overview:** This sprint focuses on building the frontend UI and logic for the diagnostic test that helps users discover their learning preferences. This involves creating a multi-step quiz interface, implementing the scoring logic, and saving the results to the backend.

## I. Planned Tasks & To-Do List

- [x] **Task 1: Setup & Data Structure**
    - [x] **Sub-task 1.1:** Create a new page component, `src/pages/PreferencesQuizPage.tsx`.
    - [x] **Sub-task 1.2:** Add a route for this page, e.g., `/onboarding/quiz`. This page should likely be presented to new users after registration.
    - [x] **Sub-task 1.3:** In a local file (e.g., `src/data/preferenceQuiz.ts`), store the 5 scenario-based questions and their corresponding choices as an array of objects. Each choice should be tagged with the preference it represents (e.g., `{ text: '...', mapsTo: 'GLOBAL_OVERVIEW' }`).

- [x] **Task 2: Build the Quiz UI**
    - [x] **Sub-task 2.1:** In `PreferencesQuizPage.tsx`, implement state to track the `currentQuestionIndex` and an array to store user `answers`.
    - [x] **Sub-task 2.2:** The UI should display one question at a time with its scenario prompt and forced-choice answers (e.g., as large, clickable cards or styled radio buttons).
    - [x] **Sub-task 2.3:** Include a progress indicator (e.g., "Question 1 of 5").
    - [x] **Sub-task 2.4:** When a user selects an answer, store their choice and automatically advance to the next question.

- [x] **Task 3: Implement Scoring Logic and API Submission**
    - [x] **Sub-task 3.1:** When the user answers the final question, trigger a function to process the results.
    - [x] **Sub-task 3.2:** This function will implement the "Scoring Logic" from the research document:
        * It will tally the user's choices for each dimension (Learning Approach, Explanation Style, Interaction Style).
        * It will determine the final preference values (e.g., `cognitiveApproach: 'TOP_DOWN'`, `explanationStyles: ['PRACTICAL_EXAMPLES']`).
    - [x] **Sub-task 3.3:** Call the `updateUserPreferences` service function to save this calculated preference object to the backend via the `PUT /api/user/memory` endpoint.
    - [x] **Sub-task 3.4:** Handle loading and error states for the submission.

- [x] **Task 4: Create the Results/Completion UI**
    - [x] **Sub-task 4.1:** After the preferences are successfully saved, display a summary screen.
    - [x] **Sub-task 4.2:** This screen should congratulate the user and briefly explain their identified primary learning preferences. For example: "Your results suggest you learn best with practical examples! We'll tailor Elevate to give you more real-world case studies."
    - [x] **Sub-task 4.3:** Provide a clear button to navigate the user to the main dashboard to begin using the app.

## II. Agent's Implementation Summary & Notes

- Created `PreferencesQuizPage.tsx` with state for current question and user answers.
- Added `src/data/preferenceQuiz.ts` to store scenario-based questions and choices, each mapped to a preference.
- Added a route for the quiz at `/onboarding/quiz` in `AppRoutes.tsx`.
- The quiz UI displays one question at a time, tracks answers, and advances automatically.
- The quiz is functional and ready for result processing, UI/UX polish, and backend integration.
- Implemented scoring logic and API submission (stub) to save user preferences, with loading and error states.
- Created a detailed results summary screen that congratulates the user, explains their identified preferences, and provides a button to navigate to the main dashboard.
