Sprint ##: Frontend - "My Progress" Page Implementation
Date Range: [Start Date] - [End Date]
Primary Focus: Frontend - MyProgressPage.tsx & Data Visualization Components
Overview: This sprint focuses on building the user-facing "My Progress" page. The goal is to create a multi-level, data-rich interface where users can view their learning statistics at an overall, folder, and question set level, with a heavy emphasis on data visualization (charts, progress bars) as per the user-provided wireframes (image_15b295.png).

Reference Design:

Layout & Style: Based on the three-view wireframe (image_15b295.png). This will require a dynamic, multi-column layout and several new, reusable data visualization components.

Styling Method: Continue using CSS Modules and the established global theme variables (theme.css) for a clean, white, and sharp aesthetic.

I. Planned Tasks & To-Do List
[x] Task 1: Foundational Setup & Reusable Charting Components

[x] Sub-task 1.1: Created MasteryLineChart component with smooth animations and tooltips
- Implemented responsive line chart using Recharts
- Added custom tooltips with formatted dates
- Included area gradient for better visualization
- Made mobile-responsive with proper scaling

[x] Sub-task 1.2: Created CircularProgress component
- Built animated circular progress indicator
- Added support for custom sizes, colors, and labels
- Implemented hover and click interactions
- Ensured responsive behavior

[x] Sub-task 1.3: Created SegmentedProgressBar component
- Implemented flexible progress bar with multiple segments
- Added specialized UUESegmentedProgressBar for Understand/Use/Explore scores
- Included customizable colors and labels
- Made it fully responsive

[ ] Task 2: Implement Overall Progress View (Default View of /my-progress)

[ ] Sub-task 2.1: In MyProgressPage.tsx, on initial load, fetch overall stats from GET /api/reviews/stats and the user's top-level folders from GET /api/folders.

[ ] Sub-task 2.2: Build the UI for the Overall Progress View (leftmost wireframe):

Display the main MasteryLineChart with overall mastery history (this may require a new endpoint GET /api/stats/user/mastery-history or using aggregated data).

Display a "Sets missed" component (using data like dueSets from the stats endpoint).

Display a grid of CircularProgress components, one for each top-level Folder returned from the API, showing its currentMasteryScore. Each of these should be a <Link> to /my-progress/folders/:folderId.

Display the overall SegmentedProgressBar with the user's average U-U-E scores from the stats endpoint.

[x] Task 3: Implement Folder-Specific Statistics View

[x] Sub-task 3.1: Added a nested route in AppRoutes.tsx for folder stats: `/my-progress/folders/:folderId`.

[x] Sub-task 3.2: Created FolderProgressView to detect `folderId` in the URL and fetch data from `GET /api/stats/folders/:folderId/details`.

[x] Sub-task 3.3: Built the UI for the Folder-Specific View:
- Reused MasteryLineChart for the folder's masteryHistory.
- Used UUESegmentedProgressBar to display aggregate understandScore, useScore, and exploreScore.
- Displayed a responsive grid of CircularProgress components for each question set, each linking to `/my-progress/sets/:setId`.

[x] Task 4: Implement Question Set-Specific Statistics View

[x] Sub-task 4.1: Added a nested route for question set stats: `/my-progress/sets/:setId` in the router.

[x] Sub-task 4.2: Created QuestionSetProgressView that detects `setId` in the URL and fetches data from `GET /api/stats/questionsets/:setId/details` and `GET /api/questionsets/:setId/questions`.

[x] Sub-task 4.3: Built the UI for the Question Set-Specific View:
- Reused MasteryLineChart for the set's masteryHistory.
- Used UUESegmentedProgressBar for the set's U-U-E scores.
- Created and used QuestionStatItem to display each question's text and score.
- Rendered a clean, responsive list of questions as per the wireframe.

[x] Task 5: Final Styling & Polish

[x] Breadcrumbs navigation added to all stats pages for clear drill-down/up navigation.
[x] Reviewed and polished CSS Modules for all stats pages: consistent spacing, card shadows, hover/focus states, and mobile breakpoints.
[x] Ensured all pages use global theme variables and maintain a clean, modern look.
[x] Accessibility improvements: keyboard navigation, visible focus states, and aria-labels for navigation clarity.
[x] Performed QA for mobile and desktop responsiveness.

[ ] Sub-task 5.1: Ensure all new components (MasteryLineChart, CircularProgress, etc.) and the overall MyProgressPage are styled consistently with your "clean and white" wireframe aesthetic using CSS Modules.

[ ] Sub-task 5.2: Implement clear "Back" buttons or breadcrumb navigation to allow users to easily move between the three drill-down views (Overall -> Folder -> Question Set).
Sub-task 5.3: Confirm the page and its charts are responsive.
