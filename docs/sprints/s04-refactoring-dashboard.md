Sprint 04: Frontend - Dashboard UI Refactor
Date Range: June 7, 2025 - June 10, 2025
Primary Focus: Frontend - DashboardPage.tsx
Overview: This sprint focuses on refactoring the DashboardPage.tsx component to align with the new user-provided wireframe (image_6c141c.png). The goal is to implement a two-column layout for the main widgets, remove the "Stats Summary" widget, and update navigation links and text labels for clarity and consistency.

I. Planned Tasks & To-Do List
[ ] Task 1: Refactor DashboardPage.tsx Layout

[ ] Sub-task 1.1: In DashboardPage.module.css (or equivalent style file), modify the grid container for the widgets. Change it from a three-column layout to a two-column layout for desktop views (e.g., grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr; to give "Today's Tasks" more space).

[X] Sub-task 1.2: In the DashboardPage.tsx component's JSX, remove the <StatsSummaryWidget ... /> component instance entirely.

[X Sub-task 1.3: Ensure the "Welcome back, Antonio!" section is positioned correctly above the new two-column grid.

[X] Sub-task 1.4: Verify that the layout correctly stacks into a single column on smaller/mobile screens.

[X] Task 2: Update Widget Content and Data Display

[X] Sub-task 2.1: In TodaysTasksWidget.tsx (and its "little card" sub-component), replace the placeholder "M" with the actual mastery score from the API data (e.g., task.currentTotalMasteryScore). Format it clearly, for example: "Mastery: 75%".

[X] Sub-task 2.2: In RecentProgressWidget.tsx, replace the placeholder "M1-M2" with the actual mastery score from the API data (e.g., item.currentTotalMasteryScore), also formatted as a percentage.

[X] Task 3: Update Navigation and Links

[ ] Sub-task 3.1: In Sidebar.tsx, locate the navigation item for "Stats". Change its name property to "My Progress" and update its href to point to /my-progress.

[ ] Sub-task 3.2: In RecentProgressWidget.tsx, locate the "View Full Statistics" button/link at the bottom of the widget. Change its text to "Go to My Progress" and ensure it navigates to the same route (/my-progress).

[ ] Sub-task 3.3: In AppRoutes.tsx, update the route for the statistics page from /stats to /my-progress.

[ ] Task 4: Final Review & Cleanup

[ ] Sub-task 4.1: Review the dashboard with the new layout and ensure all spacing, alignment, and styling is consistent with the wireframe and the established light theme.

[ ] Sub-task 4.2: Remove any unused state or props from DashboardPage.tsx that were related to the deleted StatsSummaryWidget.
