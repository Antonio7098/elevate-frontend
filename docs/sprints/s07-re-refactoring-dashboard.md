Sprint ##: Frontend - Dashboard Refactor to Final Layout
Date Range: June 9, 2025 - [End Date]
Primary Focus: Frontend - DashboardPage.tsx & associated components/styles
Overview: This sprint focuses on a complete visual and structural refactor of the DashboardPage.tsx to align with the user-provided wireframe (image_6c141c.png). The primary goals are to implement a two-column widget layout, remove the "Stats Summary" widget, and ensure all data display and navigation links are updated to reflect the new design and terminology ("My Progress").

Reference Design:

Layout & Style: Based on the user-provided wireframe (image_6c141c.png).

Styling Method: Continue using CSS Modules and the established global theme variables (theme.css).

I. Planned Tasks & To-Do List
[x] Task 1: Implement New Dashboard Layout & Welcome Section

[x] Sub-task 1.1: In DashboardPage.tsx, create a new top-level "Welcome" section. Wrap the <h1>Welcome back, Antonio!</h1> and the dynamic paragraph about today's tasks in a distinct container div (e.g., <div className={styles.welcomeSection}>).

[x] Sub-task 1.2: In DashboardPage.module.css, style the .welcomeSection to have a clean white background, padding, subtle border, and box-shadow, making it a full-width banner at the top of the content area.

[x] Sub-task 1.3: In DashboardPage.module.css, update the .dashboardContainer grid. Change its grid-template-columns for desktop to a two-column layout (e.g., grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr; to give "Today's Tasks" more space).

[x] Sub-task 1.4: In DashboardPage.tsx, remove the <StatsSummaryWidget ... /> component instance from the JSX. The .dashboardContainer should now only contain TodaysTasksWidget and RecentProgressWidget.

[x] Task 2: Update Widget Content and Data Display

[x] Sub-task 2.1: In the TodaysTasksWidget.tsx (and its inner card component), ensure the mastery indicator placeholder ("M") is replaced with the actual mastery score from the API data (e.g., task.currentTotalMasteryScore), formatted clearly (e.g., "Mastery: 75%").

[x] Sub-task 2.2: In the RecentProgressWidget.tsx (and its inner card component), ensure the progress indicator placeholder ("M1-M2") is replaced with the actual mastery score from the API data (e.g., item.currentTotalMasteryScore), also formatted as a percentage.

[x] Sub-task 2.3: In TodaysTasksWidget.tsx, verify the "Begin todays tasks" button is correctly positioned at the bottom of the widget as per the wireframe.

[x] Task 3: Final Review & Cleanup

[x] Sub-task 3.1: Review the completed DashboardPage against the wireframe (image_6c141c.png) to ensure the layout, structure, and spacing are a close match.

[x] Sub-task 3.2: Confirm the new two-column layout is responsive and stacks to a single column on smaller mobile screens.

[x] Sub-task 3.3: Remove any unused CSS from DashboardPage.module.css related to the old three-column layout or the deleted StatsSummaryWidget.
