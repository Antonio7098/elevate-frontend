sprint# Sprint 10: Unified Question Set Creation Modal

**Date Range:** [Start Date] - [End Date]
**Primary Focus:** Frontend - Unified Modal for Question Set Creation (AI + Manual)
**Overview:**
Implement a unified modal for creating question sets, combining both AI-powered question generation and manual question addition. The modal should allow users to generate questions from source material using the AI endpoint, review and edit/delete generated questions, manually add new questions via a secondary modal, and save the complete set. This will replace the current separate flows and improve UX consistency.

## I. Planned Tasks & To-Do List (Derived from Gemini's Prompt)

- [x] **Task 1:** Refactor/Create a reusable `CreateQuestionSetModal` component
    - [x] *Sub-task 1.1:* Move AI-powered set creation logic from `CreateAiQuestionSetPage` into the modal
    - [x] *Sub-task 1.2:* Add state and UI for displaying generated questions
- [x] **Task 2:** Implement manual question addition via a secondary modal (`AddQuestionModal`)
    - [x] *Sub-task 2.1:* Modal for entering question text, type, marks, marking scheme, and focus
    - [x] *Sub-task 2.2:* Add created question to the main modal's questions list
- [x] **Task 3:** Integrate the unified modal into the Folders/Question Sets page
    - [x] *Sub-task 3.1:* Replace old "New Set" modal with the new unified modal
    - [x] *Sub-task 3.2:* Ensure correct API calls for saving sets and questions
- [x] **Task 4:** Polish UI/UX and test all modal flows
    - [x] *Sub-task 4.1:* Ensure error handling, loading states, and edge cases are covered
    - [x] *Sub-task 4.2:* Update styles as needed for consistency

## II. Agent's Implementation Summary & Notes

**Regarding Task 1: Refactor/Create a reusable `CreateQuestionSetModal` component**
* **Summary of Implementation:**
    * Created `CreateQuestionSetModal.tsx` in `src/components/`.
    * Moved AI-powered question set creation logic and form UI from `CreateAiQuestionSetPage.tsx` into the modal.
    * Modal supports folder selection, set name, source text, question count, focus, error handling, and AI-powered question generation.
    * Displays generated questions in a list.
* **Key Files Modified/Created:**
    * `src/components/CreateQuestionSetModal.tsx`
* **Notes/Challenges Encountered (if any):**
    * None so far. Next: add question deletion, manual question addition, and save functionality.

**Regarding Task 2: Implement manual question addition via a secondary modal (`AddQuestionModal`)**
* **Summary of Implementation:**
    * Created `AddQuestionModal.tsx` in `src/components/`.
    * Integrated it into `CreateQuestionSetModal.tsx` for manual question entry.
    * Manual questions are added to the main modal's questions list.
* **Key Files Modified/Created:**
    * `src/components/AddQuestionModal.tsx`
* **Notes/Challenges Encountered (if any):**
    * None so far. Next: implement Save functionality and integrate modal into QuestionSetsPage.

**Regarding Task 3: Integrate the unified modal into the Folders/Question Sets page**
* **Summary of Implementation:**
    * Integrated `CreateQuestionSetModal` into `QuestionSetsPage.tsx`, replacing the old modal and creation logic.
    * The Save button now creates the set and all questions using backend services.
    * The full flow (AI/manual add/delete/save) is implemented and functional.
* **Key Files Modified/Created:**
    * `src/pages/QuestionSetsPage.tsx`
* **Notes/Challenges Encountered (if any):**
    * None so far. Next: polish UI/UX and test all modal flows.

**Regarding Task 4: Polish UI/UX and test all modal flows**
* **Summary of Implementation:**
    * Added loading indicators, disabled states, and improved error handling for Save and Generate buttons.
    * Improved accessibility: focus management, aria-labels, and role attributes for modals and alerts.
    * Tested all modal flows: AI generation, manual add, delete, and save. Edge cases and error states handled.
    * Updated styles for consistency and clarity.
* **Key Files Modified/Created:**
    * `src/components/CreateQuestionSetModal.tsx`
    * `src/components/AddQuestionModal.tsx`
* **Notes/Challenges Encountered (if any):**
    * None. All flows work as intended.
