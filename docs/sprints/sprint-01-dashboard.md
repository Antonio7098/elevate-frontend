# Sprint ##: Frontend - Dashboard Implementation

**Date Range:** June 6, 2025 - [End Date]
**Primary Focus:** Frontend - `DashboardPage.tsx`
**Overview:** This sprint focuses on building the user's main Dashboard page within the "Elevate" React application. The goal is to fetch data from the `GET /api/dashboard` endpoint and display it in the three main widgets: "Today's Tasks," "Recent Progress," and "Stats Summary & Insights," using the established clean, light-themed aesthetic with boxed widgets.

## I. Planned Tasks & To-Do List

- [x] **Task 1: Create Frontend Service for Dashboard API**
    - [x] *Sub-task 1.1:* Create a new service file: `src/services/dashboardService.ts`.
    - [x] *Sub-task 1.2:* Create TypeScript `interface` or `type` definitions for the `DashboardData` response object and its nested parts (`DueTodaySet`, `RecentProgressSet`, `OverallStats`) based on the integration guide. Place these in `src/types/dashboard.types.ts`.
    - [x] *Sub-task 1.3:* Implement an `async` function `getDashboardData()` in `dashboardService.ts` that uses the `apiClient` (Axios instance) to make a `GET` request to `/dashboard`. This function should return a promise resolving to the `DashboardData` type.

- [x] **Task 2: Implement Data Fetching and State Management in `DashboardPage.tsx`**
    - [x] *Sub-task 2.1:* In `src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx`, use a `useEffect` hook to call `dashboardService.getDashboardData()` when the component mounts.
    - [x] *Sub-task 2.2:* Use `useState` to manage the component's state:
        - `dashboardData: DashboardData | null`
        - `isLoading: boolean` (to show a loading spinner).
        - `error: string | null` (to display any API errors).
    - [x] *Sub-task 2.3:* Handle the loading state by displaying a placeholder (e.g., a spinner or skeleton screen) while data is being fetched.
    - [x] *Sub-tack 2.4:* Handle error state by displaying a user-friendly error message if the API call fails.

- [x] **Task 3: Create Reusable Widget Components**
    - [x] *Sub-task 3.1:* Create `src/components/dashboard/TodaysTasksWidget.tsx`. This component will receive the `dueToday` array as a prop and render the list of due question sets.
        - **Logic:** It should differentiate between "Critical" and "Standard" due sets (e.g., based on how overdue `nextReviewAt` is) and apply the red or green card styling as discussed.
        - **UI:** Each set should be a small card within the widget. When you click on it it will take you to a review session.
    - [x] *Sub-task 3.2:* Create `src/components/dashboard/RecentProgressWidget.tsx`. This component will receive the `recentProgress` array as a prop and render the list of recently reviewed sets with their mastery scores.
    - [x] *Sub-task 3.3:* Create `src/components/dashboard/StatsSummaryWidget.tsx`. This component will receive the `overallStats` object as a prop and display the key metrics (Total Sets Mastered, Average Mastery, Study Streak). It should include a "View Full Statistics" link/button that navigates to `/stats`.
- [x] **Task 4: Implement Dashboard Page Layout**
    - [x] *Sub-task 4.1:* In `DashboardPage.tsx`, implement the responsive grid layout we designed (e.g., 2-column top row, full-width bottom row).
    - [x] *Sub-task 4.2:* Place the new widget components (`TodaysTasksWidget`, `RecentProgressWidget`, `StatsSummaryWidget`) into the grid, passing the fetched `dashboardData` to them as props.
    - [x] *Sub-task 4.3:* Ensure the page includes the "Welcome back, Antonio!" message and any other static titles.

- [ ] **Task 5: Styling and Final Touches**
    - [ ] *Sub-task 5.1:* Apply CSS to all new components to match the clean, light-themed aesthetic with well-defined "boxed" widgets. Use the `image_f5dadd.png` as a reference for layout and style, but implement the widgets as distinct cards.
    - [ ] *Sub-task 5.2:* Ensure the page is responsive and looks good on both desktop and mobile views.

## Progress Summary (as of June 6, 2025)

- **Task 1:** Service and types for dashboard API are complete. The service correctly calls `/dashboard` (no double `/api` bug).
- **Task 2:** `DashboardPage.tsx` fetches data, handles loading/error states, and is ready for widget integration. All Tailwind and static mockup code has been removed.
- **Task 3:** All widget components (`TodaysTasksWidget`, `RecentProgressWidget`, `StatsSummaryWidget`) are now built, styled with modular CSS, and integrated into `DashboardPage.tsx`. Widgets receive real data from the API.
- **Task 4:** Dashboard layout is now responsive and visually organized using CSS Modules. All widgets are arranged in a modern grid and the welcome header is styled. No inline layout styles remain.
- **Next up:** Task 5 â€” final styling polish, mobile testing, and Tailwind removal.
