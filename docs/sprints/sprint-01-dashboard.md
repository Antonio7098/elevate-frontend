# Sprint ##: Frontend - Dashboard Implementation

**Date Range:** June 6, 2025 - [End Date]
**Primary Focus:** Frontend - `DashboardPage.tsx`
**Overview:** This sprint focuses on building the user's main Dashboard page within the "Elevate" React application. The goal is to fetch data from the `GET /api/dashboard` endpoint and display it in the three main widgets: "Today's Tasks," "Recent Progress," and "Stats Summary & Insights," using the established clean, light-themed aesthetic with boxed widgets.

## I. Planned Tasks & To-Do List

- [x] **Task 1: Create Frontend Service for Dashboard API**
    - [x] *Sub-task 1.1:* Create a new service file: `src/services/dashboardService.ts`.
    - [x] *Sub-task 1.2:* Create TypeScript `interface` or `type` definitions for the `DashboardData` response object and its nested parts (`DueTodaySet`, `RecentProgressSet`, `OverallStats`) based on the integration guide. Place these in `src/types/dashboard.types.ts`.
    - [x] *Sub-task 1.3:* Implement an `async` function `getDashboardData()` in `dashboardService.ts` that uses the `apiClient` (Axios instance) to make a `GET` request to `/dashboard`. This function should return a promise resolving to the `DashboardData` type.

- [x] **Task 2: Implement Data Fetching and State Management in `DashboardPage.tsx`**
    - [x] *Sub-task 2.1:* In `src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx`, use a `useEffect` hook to call `dashboardService.getDashboardData()` when the component mounts.
    - [x] *Sub-task 2.2:* Use `useState` to manage the component's state:
        - `dashboardData: DashboardData | null`
        - `isLoading: boolean` (to show a loading spinner).
        - `error: string | null` (to display any API errors).
    - [x] *Sub-task 2.3:* Handle the loading state by displaying a placeholder (e.g., a spinner or skeleton screen) while data is being fetched.
    - [x] *Sub-tack 2.4:* Handle error state by displaying a user-friendly error message if the API call fails.

- [x] **Task 3: Create Reusable Widget Components**
    - [x] *Sub-task 3.1:* Create `src/components/dashboard/TodaysTasksWidget.tsx`. This component will receive the `dueToday` array as a prop and render the list of due question sets.
        - **Logic:** It should differentiate between "Critical" and "Standard" due sets (e.g., based on how overdue `nextReviewAt` is) and apply the red or green card styling as discussed.
        - **UI:** Each set should be a small card within the widget. When you click on it it will take you to a review session.
    - [x] *Sub-task 3.2:* Create `src/components/dashboard/RecentProgressWidget.tsx`. This component will receive the `recentProgress` array as a prop and render the list of recently reviewed sets with their mastery scores.
    - [x] *Sub-task 3.3:* Create `src/components/dashboard/StatsSummaryWidget.tsx`. This component will receive the `overallStats` object as a prop and display the key metrics (Total Sets Mastered, Average Mastery, Study Streak). It should include a "View Full Statistics" link/button that navigates to `/stats`.
- [x] **Task 4: Implement Dashboard Page Layout**
    - [x] *Sub-task 4.1:* In `DashboardPage.tsx`, implement the responsive grid layout we designed (e.g., 2-column top row, full-width bottom row).
    - [x] *Sub-task 4.2:* Place the new widget components (`TodaysTasksWidget`, `RecentProgressWidget`, `StatsSummaryWidget`) into the grid, passing the fetched `dashboardData` to them as props.
    - [x] *Sub-task 4.3:* Ensure the page includes the "Welcome back, Antonio!" message and any other static titles.

- [x] **Task 5: Styling and Final Touches**
    - [x] *Sub-task 5.1:* All dashboard components and widgets are now styled with modular CSS (CSS Modules) for a clean, light-themed, accessible look. Boxed widgets use enhanced box-shadow, border, and card polish per the reference image and design goals. Tailwind CSS has been fully removed from the codebase.
    - [x] *Sub-task 5.2:* The Dashboard page and widgets are responsive for both desktop and mobile. Extensive polish has been applied for spacing, font scaling, and accessibility (focus rings, contrast). Sidebar overlay for mobile was attempted (slide-in drawer with backdrop), but due to persistent CSS specificity/layout issues, the default sidebar remains visible on mobile for now. The code is ready for further sidebar/mobile iteration if required.

## Progress Summary (as of June 6, 2025)

- **Task 1:** Service and types for dashboard API are complete. The service correctly calls `/dashboard` (no double `/api` bug).
- **Task 2:** `DashboardPage.tsx` fetches data, handles loading/error states, and is ready for widget integration. All Tailwind and static mockup code has been removed.
- **Task 3:** All widget components (`TodaysTasksWidget`, `RecentProgressWidget`, `StatsSummaryWidget`) are now built, styled with modular CSS, and integrated into `DashboardPage.tsx`. Widgets receive real data from the API.
- **Task 4:** Dashboard layout is now responsive and visually organized using CSS Modules. All widgets are arranged in a modern grid and the welcome header is styled. No inline layout styles remain.
- **Next up:** Task 5 — final styling polish, mobile testing, and Tailwind removal.

## II. Agent's Implementation Summary & Notes

*Instructions for AI Agent (Cascade): For each planned task you complete from Section I, please provide a summary below, including notes on key files modified and any challenges or decisions made.*

### Agent Implementation Summary (Cascade)

#### Task 1–4: Dashboard Core Implementation
- Created and integrated a dashboard API service, TypeScript types, and data fetching logic in `DashboardPage.tsx`.
- Built three modular, reusable widget components: `TodaysTasksWidget`, `RecentProgressWidget`, and `StatsSummaryWidget`.
- Implemented a responsive grid layout and styled all widgets/pages using CSS Modules. All Tailwind CSS classes and dependencies were removed from the project.

#### Task 5: Styling, Polish, and Mobile QA
- Applied detailed modular CSS for all widgets and dashboard layout: box shadows, borders, card padding, hover/focus states, and accessible color contrast.
- Ensured all dashboard widgets and layout are responsive and visually consistent on both desktop and mobile.
- Attempted to implement a mobile overlay (slide-in) sidebar with a hamburger menu and backdrop. Despite correct CSS and React logic, a persistent issue with sidebar visibility on mobile remains unresolved. The sidebar currently remains visible on mobile, but the overlay/drawer code is in place for future fixes.
- All other polish, accessibility, and QA items are complete and the dashboard is visually and functionally ready for review.

**Key files modified:**
- `src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx`, `src/components/dashboard/*Widget.tsx`, `src/components/dashboard/*.module.css`, `src/components/layout/AuthenticatedLayout.tsx`, `src/components/layout/AuthenticatedLayout.module.css`, `package.json`, `postcss.config.js`, and supporting service/types files.

**Next steps:**
- Optional: Further debug/fix the sidebar overlay for mobile, or consider alternate mobile navigation patterns. Otherwise, the dashboard sprint is complete.
